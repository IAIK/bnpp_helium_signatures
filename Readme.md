The four subdirectories contain the implementation of the [BN++LowMC](https://github.com/IAIK/bnpp_helium_signatures/tree/main/bnpp_lowmc), [BN++Rain](https://github.com/IAIK/bnpp_helium_signatures/tree/main/bnpp_rain), [Helium+LowMC](https://github.com/IAIK/bnpp_helium_signatures/tree/main/helium_lowmc) and [Helium+AES](https://github.com/IAIK/bnpp_helium_signatures/tree/main/helium_aes) variants. A `Readme.md` file in the respective subfolder explains how to compile and run benchmarks.
